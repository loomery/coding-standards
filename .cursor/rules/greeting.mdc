- **After 4 times**, suppress greeting completely
- **Reset counter** only on new session/workspace

### Benefits

- **Builds excitement** for AI Powered Working activities
- **Reinforces company culture** and values
- **Creates memorable experience** without being annoying
- **Limited frequency** ensures it doesn't become repetitive

## Integration
